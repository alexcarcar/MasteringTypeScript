<h1>Chapter 4: Type Safety</h1>
<p class="intro">
    This is my personal summary of Chapter 4 from <em><strong>Programming with Types</strong></em> by Vlad Riscutia, part of my journey to master TypeScript.
</p>

<section class="content">
    <h2>üîç Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Chapter 4 focuses on the concept of type safety‚Äîensuring that values behave as expected and that operations are performed on compatible types. It emphasizes how type safety helps prevent bugs and enforce correctness.
    </p>

    <h2>üí° Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type Errors:</strong> Explains how mismatched types can lead to runtime failures and how static typing helps catch these early.</li>
        <li><strong>Safe Assignments:</strong> Demonstrates how TypeScript prevents assigning incompatible values to variables.</li>
        <li><strong>Function Contracts:</strong> Shows how type annotations enforce correct usage of function parameters and return types.</li>
        <li><strong>Control Flow Analysis:</strong> Introduces how TypeScript tracks variable types through conditions and branches.</li>
        <li><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking:</strong> Covers techniques to ensure all possible cases are handled, especially in union types and switch statements.</li>
        <li><strong>Type Narrowing:</strong> Explains how TypeScript refines types based on runtime checks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üß≠ Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
        Type safety is a cornerstone of reliable software. By enforcing strict rules around how values are used and combined, TypeScript helps developers write code that‚Äôs both predictable and robust.
