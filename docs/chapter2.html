<h1>Chapter 2: Basic Types</h1>
<p class="intro">
    This is my personal summary of Chapter 2 from <em><strong>Programming with Types</strong></em> by Vlad Riscutia, part of my journey to master TypeScript.
</p>

<section class="content">
    <h2>🔍 Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Chapter 2 explores the fundamental building blocks of type systems—basic types. These include primitive types like numbers, strings, and booleans, as well as more structured types like tuples and enums.
    </p>

    <h2>💡 Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primitive Types:</strong> Covers number, string, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol.</li>
        <li><strong>Literal Types:</strong> Introduces fixed values as types, such as `"yes"` or `42`.</li>
        <li><strong>Union Types:</strong> Explains how to combine multiple types using the `|` operator.</li>
        <li><strong>Tuple Types:</strong> Describes ordered collections with fixed types and lengths.</li>
        <li><strong>Enum Types:</strong> Shows how to define named constants for better readability and safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Type Aliases:</strong> Demonstrates how to create reusable type definitions using `type`.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧭 Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
        Mastering basic types is essential for writing expressive and safe TypeScript code. They form the foundation for more advanced type constructs and help encode intent directly into the type system.
